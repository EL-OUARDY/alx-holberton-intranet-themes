# ALX Intranet Themes & Tools

`Chrome Extension`

A Collection of Stunning Themes and Creative Tools
to Enhance Students Intranet Experience

ðŸ“¢ Before diving into the details, I want to clarify something important: Iâ€™ve made it incredibly easy for students to contribute and create their own themes. You only need to add a single JSON file containing the theme's color palette and the extension will handle the rest! [_Check how to add your own theme_](#contribution)

## Overview

The journey of studying at ALX has been truly amazing, and now weâ€™re at the final milestone. To me, it feels like saying a hard goodbye to something thatâ€™s been a part of my life every day for the past year. Thatâ€™s why I wanted to give something back to the community. I decided to create a project related to the school. The intranet, where we spent almost every day, felt like a safe space, and Iâ€™m grateful because it made learning smooth and easy. This project is inspired by someone who created a similar tool, but I want to take it further and add my own ideas. I aim to add features we always wished the intranet had. I hope it will be a blessing for the next cohorts.

## Features

âœ… **Stunning Themes** _(8 well-crafted themes and yours could be next!)_ \
âœ… **In-Task Code Highlighting**\
âœ… **Modern UI**\
âœ… **Focus Mode**\
âœ… **Progress Tracker**

## Technologies used

- `React.js` with `TypeScript`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `Shadcn/ui` components
- `JavaScript` libraries (_Highlight.js_)

> Note: You might be wondering why I used React.js and all these tools when I could have achieved the same result with vanilla JavaScript and a bit of CSS. The reason is that I wanted to apply what we've learned while also delivering a better product. Plus, donâ€™t worryâ€”it's not as complicated as it seems! React.js is only used for building the popup UI. Iâ€™ve made sure contributing is super simple for other students to create their own themesâ€”literally by just adding one JSON file with the themeâ€™s color palette.
