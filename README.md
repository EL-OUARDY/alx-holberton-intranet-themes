<hr />

ðŸ“¢ Before diving into the details, I want to clarify something important: Iâ€™ve made it incredibly easy for students to contribute and create their own themes. You only need to add a single JSON file containing the theme's color palette and the extension will handle the rest! [_Check how to add your own theme_](#contribution)

## Overview

The journey of studying at ALX has been truly amazing, and now weâ€™re at the final milestone. To me, it feels like saying a hard goodbye to something thatâ€™s been a part of my life every day for the past year. Thatâ€™s why I wanted to give something back to the community. I decided to create a project related to the school. The intranet, where we spent almost every day, felt like a safe space, and Iâ€™m grateful because it made learning smooth and easy. This project is inspired by someone who created a similar tool, but I want to take it further and add my own ideas. I aim to add features we always wished the intranet had. I hope it will be a blessing for the next cohorts.

## Features

âœ… **Stunning Themes** _(8 well-crafted themes and yours could be next!)_ \
âœ… **In-Task Code Highlighting**\
âœ… **Modern UI**\
âœ… **Focus Mode**

## Technologies

- `React.js` with `TypeScript`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `Shadcn/ui` components
- `JavaScript` libraries (_Highlight.js_)

> Note: You might be wondering why I used React.js and all these tools when I could have achieved the same result with vanilla JavaScript and a bit of CSS. The reason is that I wanted to apply what we've learned while also delivering a better product. Plus, donâ€™t worryâ€”it's not as complicated as it seems! React.js is only used for building the popup UI. Iâ€™ve made sure contributing is super simple for other students to create their own themesâ€”literally by just adding one JSON file with the themeâ€™s color palette.

## Installation

### Method 1: `Manually`

1. **Download the ZIP File:** Get the latest version of the extension from the [Releases](https://github.com/EL-OUARDY/alx-holberton-intranet-themes/releases) page.
2. **Extract the Files:** Unzip the downloaded file to a folder on your computer.
3. **Load the Extension in Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
   - Click on **Load unpacked** and select the folder where you extracted the files.
4. **Enjoy the Extension**: It should now be installed and ready to use!

### Method 2: `Chrome Web Store`

The extension is now available on the Chrome Web Store. [_click here_](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/alx-holberton-themes-code/emoclfafkepielodpfejpicjoamogjha)

## Development

This guide is designed for developers who are new to Chrome extension development. We'll walk through each step to help you get started!

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Clone Your Forked Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-holberton-intranet-themes
   ```

2. **Install Node Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start Development Mode**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will:

   - Build the extension code
   - Watch for changes and rebuild automatically
   - Output the built files to the `/dist` directory

4. **Load the Extension in Chrome**:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable **Developer mode** in the top right corner
   - Click **Load unpacked**
   - Select the `/dist` directory from your project folder

### Important Development Notes

The project uses `React.js` for the popup UI, with the core extension functionality implemented in TypeScript.

#### Hot Reload Behavior:

- Changes to popup UI code (React components) will update automatically

- Changes to `content.ts`, `background.ts`, or files in `/public` _(including themes)_ require manually **reloading** the extension from chrome settings.

#### Key Files:

- `content.ts`: Handles DOM modifications and theme application

- `background.ts`: Manages extension lifecycle and events

- `Files in /public`: Contains extension manifest and static assets

### Project Structure

Here's an overview of key files and directories:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content.ts     # Content script for page modifications
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ background.ts  # Background script for extension events
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ public/           # Static assets and extension files
â””â”€â”€ dist/            # Built extension files (generated)
```

## Contribution

If youâ€™d like to add your own theme, simply create a `JSON` file that contains details about your theme, such as colors and other relevant information (see this [\_example.json](./public/themes/_example.json)). The extension is configured to automatically load themes from this directory, so you donâ€™t have to worry about any additional setup.
Remember, adding a file/theme to the extension folder will require you to reload the extension from the Chrome settings.

### Adding Features

To add features to the extension please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**:

   - Start by forking the repository on GitHub to your own account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:

   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-holberton-intranet-themes
     ```

3. **Create a New Branch**:

   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd alx-intranet-themes-tools
     ```
   - Create a new branch for your feature:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```

4. **Implement Your Feature**:

   - Make the necessary changes in the code to add your desired feature.
   - Be sure to test your changes locally to ensure everything works as expected.

5. **Commit Your Changes**:

   - Once youâ€™re satisfied with your feature, commit your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "a clear and descriptive message about your feature or changes"
     ```

6. **Push to Your Fork**:

   - Push your changes to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a pull request from your feature branch. Provide a brief description of the changes you made and why they should be merged.
